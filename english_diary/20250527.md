今日は仕事で酷い目にあったよ。
朝出勤したら自分のPCがなぜかつかなくて、その理由も全然わからなくてさ
PCの電源はついてるのに、モニターに映像が出力されなくてケーブルを差し替えたり、モニターを他のやつを使ってみたりしたんだけど、ダメだったよ。
それで会社の中にサポートデスクっていう相談所みたいなところがあるからそこにPCを持ち込んだら、普通に使えますよとか言われたんだよ！
それでまた自分の席に戻って再接続したら普通に電源ついてさ、もう意味わかんなかったよ笑

Today, It happened to me at the office.
Once I got to the office and I tried to turn up my PC but it did'nt work well.
I didn't know why.
PC's power was on but a monitor did'nt display picture.
So, I tried to fix it to change the cable and monitor but it was not good.
After that, I went to support desk in the office and bring my PC there, then the support worker said that this PC was fine, and there is no probrem.
I was really surprised.
I had no choice to turn back my seat and tried to recconect the PC, then PC was fine.
I was very very confused.

Man, today was a mess at work.
When I got in this morning, my PC just wouldn’t turn on — and I had no idea why.
The power light was on, but nothing showed up on the monitor.
I tried switching cables and even tested with a different monitor, but still nothing.
So I took it over to the support desk, and they were like, “It’s working fine.”
I was like, what!?
Then I brought it back to my desk, plugged everything in again… and suddenly it worked like nothing ever happened.
I was so confused. Seriously, what was that!?
