これは一昨日の出来事なんだけど、俺の会社の社長が交代するっていう知らせが仕事から帰る直前に来たんだよね。社内で緊急会見みたいなことをしてさ、めっちゃびっくりしたよ。
っていうのも今の社長は社長になってから11年間もやり続けていて、業績も順調なんだよ？
一体何が理由で交代するんだろう。。。
それに社長が交代することによって自分の労働環境が変わらないか不安だよ。
正直、会社に入って2ヶ月目で社長交代するなんて面白い展開ではあるけどね笑

This happened the day before yesterday.
Just before I left work, I got the news that the president of my company was going to be replaced.  
There was even an emergency meeting held in the office, and I was really surprised.
That's because the current president has been in the position for 11 years and the company has been doing well.
I wonder what the reason for this change is...
I'm also a bit worried that my working environment might change because of it.
To be honest, it's kind of an interesting twist, after all , 
it's only been two months since I joined the company.lol
